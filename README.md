# DVLD (Driving License Management System)

A **C# .NET WinForms application** for managing driving licenses and related services.  
This project was developed between **May ‚Äì July 2025** as part of a learning journey to practice **database integration, and layered architecture (3-tier design)**.  

The system simulates the operations of a **Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD)**, ensuring proper management of licenses, applicants, and services.
